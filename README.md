BigJMuffin - OyVey fetish.

pauI - "pro" Java "dev" (Doesn't even know what a "Short" is).

zPrestige_ - Mega OyVey fetish & his prestige base is so bad my god.

2b2tbuilder/DerpyJibs - Femboy & north korean coder.

ObsidianBreaker/accessmodifier364 - Fetish for w+2 (This was awhile ago tho, so he might actually be able to code now).

Catuquei - OyVey Fetish. (Starting to see a pattern with pvpers and them "coding" new clients).

0x22 - Pasted his entire client "Future" from Exeter. It seems he has become a much better developer now, but his client still contains uses old ass Exeter code that he refuses to rewrite. (just look at the gui ðŸ’€)

Hqrion - Got recognition for making the leaked 1.7.2 phobos buildable. Turns out, it was completely done by his friend Ciruu, and the "SRC" was crashing useless garbage.

Ciruu - Made quite possible the most skidded kami skid to ever exist, "Zispanos Backdoor" back in the day. Now he spends his time on his exit scam, "Abyss" and pasting phobos and summit.

Novola/Trental - Somehow convinced Gopro to make oyvey buildable (a god auful decision). Then they proceeded to make the original oyvey paste called "Zori" that started this horrible trend.

RageMachine/ManOnTheMoon - Retarded wannabe developer (yet refuses to properly learn to code). Created a paste straight from hell called "synapse", Sold it, pulled a pyro, and then faked various real-life crises as excuses for leaving the project. (There were no refunds).

Hollow - Incel that seems to somewhat know Java, yet their client "Trollgod" is worthless, phobos-pasted garbage.

Chardn0l - Reps trollgod like he's the best client, deep throats hollows dong, and larps about being a gangster, even though we all know he's a skinny white incel that gets bullied at school.
